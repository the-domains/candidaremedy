What is Candida?

It is a genus (type) of yeast (which is a member of the Fungi Kingdom) that develops a pseudomycelium (big word meaning the yeast individually combine as a group and creates a chain) and reproduce by budding.

Now Candida is a normal part of our body. It is found in the flora of the gut, mouth, skin and vagina.

When most people discuss having a Candida or yeast infection (candidiasis), they are likely referring to Candida Albicans, but it can be other forms of Candida that they are infected with. It likes warm and moist environments, hence the explanation of where they reside.

An infection happens when something changes the environment of where they reside or the immune system is compromised somehow (autoimmune condition). E.g. Taking an anti-biotic that kills off the bacteria that keeps Candida in check thus allowing it to grow out of control.

So in a nut shell, Candida is a normal part of our bodies and when something changes the environment that it resides in, it can grow and create problems.
